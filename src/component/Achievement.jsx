      With the assistance of the NASA EMIT satellite, significant accomplishments have been
        made.
        <br />
        In 2020, the satellite observed how winds in Africa carried surface mineral dust into
        the atmosphere, which then traversed the Atlantic Ocean, impacting states from Florida to
        Texas.
        <br />
        This event shed light on the extensive impacts of mineral dust on Earth.
