        <h3>ESRL Global Monitoring Laboratory</h3>
        <p>Data Visualization Helps view the localized  area of high carbon and methane concentration and regions with high surface reflectance</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Potential Application</h3>
        <p>
        EMIT data could enable detection of a variety of natural hazards and could be used to guide disaster management strategies.
        Coastal waters and harmful algal blooms The EMIT sensor can be used to monitor ocean phytoplankton, harmful algal bloom biomass and composition,
        coral presence and bleaching events, and the health of coastal ecosystems.

        <h3>Environmental pollution</h3>
        <p>Spectrometers like EMIT have been used to map oil extent from the deep water horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, plastics in the environment, and to accelerate clean up of an acid mine superfund site in Leadville, CO.
        As EMIT acquires data across the globe, there is great potential to use them to assist with environmental clean up in response to disasters such as oil spills and remediation efforts to clean up historic mine sites.

        <h3>Agricultural monitoring</h3>
        <p>
            EMIT will collect data over many of the world's agricultural regions.
        Depending on the season and crop management, these data can provide information on crop types, vegetation health and disease, crop residue composition, and soil mineralogy.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Forest management & fire</h3>
        <p>
        Data from EMIT could be used to monitor forest health through the water content of canopies, composition and dry biomass that make up fire fuels, and low risk areas where vegetation is absent, creating a nuanced perspective of fire risk across forest landscapes.
        Further, EMIT data can be used after a wildfire to assess recovery and monitor ongoing risks associated with debris flows and landslides in regions with poor vegetation regrowth.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Vegetation community and biodiversity monitoring </h3>
        <p>
        EMIT data provide an opportunity to establish baseline maps of vegetation communities around the globe to help monitor ecosystem health, biodiversity loss, and conservation efforts.
        These maps could also be used to map the habitat of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, to assist public health efforts to contain vector borne diseases.

       <h3>Overview</h3>
        <h4>Instrument</h4>
        <small>EMIT When the various wavelengths of light</small>

        <br />
        <h4>The spectrum</h4>
        <small>Distributed across the instrument’s detector, they display unique spectral signatures indicating the mineral composition of the surface.
        EMIT will acquire over 100,000 such spectra every second, mapping the composition of minerals on Earth’s surface.
